## Goals (Minimum Requirements)

To build a **Command Line CRUD App** that uses a database to persist information.
The goal of which is to demonstrate all of the skills learned in module one:

- Ruby
- Object Orientation
- Relationships (via ActiveRecord)
- Problem Solving (via creating a Command Line Interface (CLI))

**minimum requirements** for this project are to build a Command Line App that:

1. Contains at least three models with corresponding tables, including a join table.
2. Accesses a Sqlite3 database using ActiveRecord.
3. Has a CLI that allows users to interact with your database as defined by your _user stories_ (minimum of four; one for each CRUD action).
4. Uses good OO design patterns. You should have separate models for your runner and CLI interface.
